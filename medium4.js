//Create a car object with the items: Make, Model, Year, Milage, and Color. Then create 3 methods in the object; A driveToWork method, driveAroundTheWorld method, and runErrands method. Each of these methods should affect the carâ€™s mileage adding to it each time and console logging the old mileage and the new mileage.
